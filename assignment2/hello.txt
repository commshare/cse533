Hello World, how you doing. THis is such a waste of time. You should not be sitting at home and coding like a nerd, goi out and have some fun. blah blah blah.The struct iovec defines one vector element. Normally, this structure is used as an array of multiple elements. For each transfer element, the pointer member iov_base points to a buffer that is receiving data for readv or is transmitting data for writev. The member iov_len in each case determines the maximum receive length and the actual write length, respectively.The functions readv and writev both use a concept of an I/O vector. The sys/uio.h include file defines the struct iovec, which is defined as follows:Brother what is happening in Gaza is totally inhumane i agree with you.. and i support your cause. terrorism has no religion. god bless gaza. i also want to mention that what is happening in iraq and syria is also inhumane. what ISIS is doing to people there should not be supported. we should come together to denounce any kind of violence that is taking place in the name of religion ﻿Hello World, how you doing.
